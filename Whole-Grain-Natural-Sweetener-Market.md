The increasing demand for healthier, more sustainable alternatives to traditional sweeteners, along with growing consumer awareness about the benefits of whole grains, is driving the market's growth. As the food and beverage industry continues to shift towards natural ingredients and cleaner labels, whole grain-based sweeteners, such as those derived from barley, oats, and other grains, are gaining popularity for their nutritional advantages and lower glycemic impact compared to refined sugars.</p><p>In addition, the rise in the demand for plant-based and organic products is further propelling the adoption of whole grain natural sweeteners in various applications, including baked goods, snacks, dairy, and beverages. This market is expected to expand as consumers continue to look for healthier alternatives without compromising on taste. The increased focus on health and wellness is also expected to bolster the market for whole grain sweeteners, particularly among health-conscious and environmentally aware consumers.
